This Python script sets up a basic keylogger using the pynput library to log key presses and releases. 
Here's a description of the code:

Description:
Import Statements:

logging: Python's built-in logging module for creating log files.
keyboard from pynput: A library for monitoring and controlling input devices.
datetime: Module to work with dates and times in Python.
Logging Configuration:

log_file: Specifies the filename (key_log.txt) where key press information will be logged.
logging.basicConfig: Sets up the logging configuration:
filename: Specifies the file to write logs (key_log.txt).
level=logging.DEBUG: Sets the logging level to DEBUG, which captures all log messages.
format='%(asctime)s: %(message)s': Defines the format of each log entry with a timestamp (asctime) and the message (message).
Event Handlers:

on_press(key): Function called when a key is pressed:
Logs the pressed key using logging.info.
Special keys like space, enter, backspace, tab, and escape are handled explicitly to log their names ([SPACE], [ENTER], etc.).
Returns False when the Escape key (keyboard.Key.esc) is pressed to stop the listener.
on_release(key): Optional function for logging key releases:
Currently commented out (# logging.info(f'Key released: {key}')), it could be used to log when keys are released.
Listener Setup and Execution:

with keyboard.Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener: Sets up a listener object that monitors keyboard events:
on_press: Specifies the function to call when a key is pressed.
on_release: Specifies the function to call when a key is released (optional).
listener.join(): Starts the listener and waits for it to finish.
Usage:
Functionality: This script captures and logs all keyboard input while it is running, storing the logged keys and their timestamps in key_log.txt.
Ethical Considerations: Ensure that this tool is used ethically and legally, respecting privacy and obtaining necessary permissions when monitoring keystrokes.
This keylogger implementation can be further customized or enhanced based on specific requirements, such as encrypting log files or adding more detailed logging capabilities.
